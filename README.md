# Backlog-Jukebox
Manage your music backlog! I have so much music in my music library, I forget what albums I have yet to listen to. This is why I created
Backlog Jukebox. You can easily add albums to a library that still need to be listened to. When you want to listen to an album in your 
backlog, Backlog Jukebox will pick a random album from your backlog for you to listen to. When you've listened to the album, you can 
easily remove the album.

If you find any bugs please email me at trevordavies095@gmail.com
